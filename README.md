Download an entire Spotify playlist (FROM SPOTIFY @ 160kbps) to your local machine.

Also upon download it writes the ID3 data to the file.

### To install
Install nodejs if you haven't already. ([NodeJS Downloads](http://nodejs.org/download/))

	npm install -g spotify-playlist-downloader

You will also need ffmpeg installed.

In mac terminal:

	brew install ffmpeg


### Available Options

	
	Usage: spotify-playlist-downloader [options]
	
	Options:

	    -h, --help                   output usage information
	    -V, --version                output the version number
	    -u, --username [username]    Spotify Username (required)

#### So if you wanted to download "Top 100 Hip-Hop Tracks on Spotify". You would use the following command

	spd -u yourusername -p yourpassword -l spotify:user:spotify:playlist:06KmJWiQhL0XiV6QQAHsmw

`spd` is the shorthand for `spotify-playlist-downloader`. You can use either one.

#### The output should look something like
